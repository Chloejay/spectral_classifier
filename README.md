This repo is used to demo the feature engineering task for a data job interview.

#### Data source 
Chemical Spectra and near-infrared spectroscopy data sets in Tobacco industry. 
- Infra-Red (IR), Near Infra-Red (NIR) 近红外光谱 and Raman Spectroscopy (拉曼散射光谱) theory =>特征峰的波数和强度
- Sepctral analysis in chemometrics field (化学计量学).


#### Experiments, typical for classification modeling
- Find peaks of spectrum 
- supervised linear regression 
- PCA 
- SVM 
- KNN 
- CNN for deep feature extraction

**(for time limited, I only start this task from this Sunday afternoon, so much research work and code refactor is under the progress in limited deadline.)**
